//! ## Stack layout
//!
//! Here is what the layout of the stack looks like when a coroutine is
//! suspended.
//!
//! Note: "link area" refers to the minimal 32-byte stack frame header that is
//! required by the PowerPC ABI.
//!
//! ```text
//! +--------------+  <- Stack base
//! | Padding      |  <-
//! +--------------+   |
//! | Initial func |  <-
//! +--------------+   | This mirrors the 32-byte link area layout.
//! | Padding      |  <-
//! +--------------+   |
//! | Parent link  |  <-
//! +--------------+ <- The 4 fields above form a fake link area which
//! |              |    backchains back to the parent stack.
//! ~     ...      ~
//! |              |
//! +--------------+
//! |              |
//! | Link area    |  <- 32-byte link area of the last frame before the suspend.
//! |              |     The LR field holds the PC to resume execution at.
//! +--------------+  <- Saved stack pointer points here.
//! | Saved R31    |
//! +--------------+
//! | Saved R30    |
//! +--------------+
//! | Saved R29    |
//! +--------------+
//! | Saved R2     |
//! +--------------+
//! ```
//!
//! And this is the layout of the parent stack when a coroutine is running:
//!
//! ```text
//! |           |
//! ~    ...    ~
//! |           |
//! +-----------+
//! |           |
//! | Link area |  <- 32-byte link area of the last frame before the suspend.
//! |           |     The LR field holds the PC to resume execution at.
//! +-----------+  <- Parent link points here.
//! | Saved R31 |
//! +-----------+
//! | Saved R30 |
//! +-----------+
//! | Saved R29 |
//! +-----------+
//! | Saved R2  |
//! +-----------+
//! ```
//!
//! And finally, this is the stack layout of a coroutine that has just been
//! initialized:
//!
//! ```text
//! +--------------+  <- Stack base
//! | Padding      |
//! +--------------+
//! | Initial func |
//! +--------------+
//! | Padding      |
//! +--------------+
//! | Parent link  |
//! +--------------+
//! |              |
//! ~ Initial obj  ~
//! |              |
//! +--------------+
//! | Padding      |  <-
//! +--------------+   |
//! | Initial PC   |  <-
//! +--------------+   | This mirrors the 32-byte link area layout.
//! | Padding      |  <-
//! +--------------+   |
//! | Padding      |  <-
//! +--------------+  <- Initial SP points here
//! | Saved R31    |
//! +--------------+
//! | Saved R30    |
//! +--------------+
//! | Saved R29    |
//! +--------------+
//! | Saved R2     |
//! +--------------+  <- stack top
//! ```
